# Build libcap as static library. Unfortunately, the name of the
# library is hard-coded in the kernel build system to be lib.a. (We
# have an extra build step that cp's lib.a -> libcap.a.)

# Note: Kernel expects the files to be relative paths (it always prepends
# the current directory).

# This single line of magic makes it so we can do an out of src tree
# build. It has to do with how and where this Kbuild file is included
# in the kernel build system.
src = @abs_top_srcdir@/src

# This needs to be inside here because the kernel build system forces gcc
# otherwise.
